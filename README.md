#  Welcome to Magic Cards! 

Magic Cards is a delightful project dedicated to showcasing a curated collection of beautiful magic cards. My codebase is designed with best practices in mind, featuring Clean Architecture, Dependency Injection (Get It), Functional Programming (Dartz), and comprehensive testing with Mocktail and Flutter Bloc. We leverage Retrofit for HTTP operations, implement the powerful BLoC pattern for state management, and ensure immutability using Freezed. But that's not all – there's much more under the hood! Explore the repository to discover the purr-fect blend of tech and feline charm. 🐱✨
